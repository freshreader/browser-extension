    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! One last thing before you can start saving URLs to your Freshreader list.</p>
    <p>
      For privacy purposes, the good people at Mozilla and Google require that
      I get your consent to collect the URL of your active tab whenever you
      click on the "Save to Freshreader" icon. This behavior is required so that
      the extension can send the URL to the Freshreader server and actually save
      the URL to your Freshreader list.
    </p>

    <p>
      You must consent to this behavior to use the add-on. If you do not consent,
      uninstall this add-on and save URLs manually from your Freshreader list.
    <p>
